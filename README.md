# Automad Bulma Theme Modified

A modified version of the [dahmen/automad-bulma](https://packages.automad.org/dahmen/automad-bulma) theme.  

## Changes

- The hero/project slideshows only display images which include the term `slide` in its filename.  
- The hero slideshow selects `webp`, `avif`, and `jpeg` extensions in addition to the stock `png` and `jpg`.
- Made `Hide Title And Teaser` function on most templates, making it possible to hide the autogenerated page title for fine-grain page content control.  
- Added `Hide Page Menu`, making it possible to hide the in-page menus for a similar fine-grain tuning effect.  
- Completely removed the sign-in URL in the footer.
- Added a Minimal Page template which includes nothing except the navbar and footer.  
- Forced the pages to be at minimum the full height of the screen; footer no longer floats upwards on pages with short content.

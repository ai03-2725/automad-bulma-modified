# Automad Bulma Theme Modified

A modified version of the [dahmen/automad-bulma](https://packages.automad.org/dahmen/automad-bulma) theme.  

## Changes

- Slideshows/carousels/heroes only display images with the term `slide` in its filename.  
- The carousels search for `webp`, `avif`, and `jpeg` extensions in addition to the stock `png` and `jpg`.
- Made the `Hide Title And Teaser` option apply to most pages.
- Added the `Hide Page Menu` option for hiding in-page navigation menus.
- Removed the sign-in URL in the footer.
- Added a Minimal Page template which includes nothing except the navbar and footer.  
- Forced the pages to be at minimum the full height of the screen; footer no longer floats upwards on pages with short content.
